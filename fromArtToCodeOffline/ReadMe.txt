This is part of the functionality of the tabageos editor that is still in the making.
The editor will take art and strings as input and output full complete games using tabageos, 
it will output for android apk and to html5.
Behind the scenes im already using it but its still very pre alpha, this code is a javascript version of some of the editors functionality.

It's possible to use the integer arrays with other game making tools, but the other array outputs are tabageos specific.
Also the animation code output is tabageos specific.
The code that the fromArtToCode page outputs is yours, but not the pages code itself.

This offline version is available such that you can make your games without having to be online.
just lauch the index file.
