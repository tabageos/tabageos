# How to contribute

You can contribute by fixing bugs or improving the docs, or adding in new features to the source. 

## Reporting issues

[GitHub Issues][0] is the place to report bugs you may have found. When submitting an issue please do the following:

**1. Search for existing issues.** Your bug may have already been fixed, or addressed.

**2. Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** If you are reporting a bug, make sure you also have a minimal, runnable, example that reproduces the problem you have.

**4. Include a live example.** After narrowing your code down to only the problem, make use of [jsFiddle][1], [jsBin][2], [CodePen][3].

**5. Share as much information as possible.** Include browser version affected, your OS, version of the library, steps to reproduce, etc. 

## Changes

After a PR is submitted it is reviewed and the changes are manually added if the PR is accepted.

## Coding Guide

Any Core Class changes need to be written in prototype es5 format, tabageos tries to be backwards compatible for browsers released 2015-2018 and older systems.

Please look over the existing sources and follow the same conventions.
