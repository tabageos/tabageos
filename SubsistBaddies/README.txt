You can learn from this code to make your own unique game,

however with this code is just a black and white version of the sprite sheet.

Looking over and playing with the code gives a good overview of using tabageos for all major elements needed in any game;
title screen functionality, main camera screen, level complete and upgrade screens and a game over screen.
Also you see bullet movement and pools, and basic platform enemy ai movement.
